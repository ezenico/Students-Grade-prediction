# Students-Grade-prediction
In this project, I explored the linear regression method to predict students' final grades based on multiple factors from the dataset. The process involved data preparation, visualization, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.

The dataset was first loaded and the relevant columns were selected for the model. A 3D visualization of the data was created to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable. The data was then split into training and testing sets, and a linear regression model was trained. The accuracy of the model was evaluated, and the coefficients and intercept were printed to understand the impact of each feature. Finally, the model was saved for future use, and predictions were made on the test set to compare with the actual grades.
